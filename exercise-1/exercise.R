# Exercise 1: creating and accessing lists

# Create a vector `my_breakfast` of everything you ate for breakfast
  my_breakfast <- c("almonds", "coffee")

# Create a vector `my_lunch` of everything you ate (or will eat) for lunch
  my_lunch <- c("banana", "chicken")

# Create a list `meals` that has contains your breakfast and lunch
  meals <- list(breakfast = my_breakfast, lunch = my_lunch)

# Add a "dinner" element to your `meals` list that has what you plan to eat 
# for dinner
  meals$dinner <- c("pasta")

# Use dollar notation to extract your `dinner` element from your list
# and save it in a vector called 'dinner'
  dinner <- meals$dinner

# Use double-bracket notation to extract your `lunch` element from your list
# and save it in your list as the element at index 5 (no reason beyond practice)
  meals[[5]] <- meals[["lunch"]]

# Use single-bracket notation to extract your breakfast and lunch from your list
# and save them to a list called `early_meals`
  early_meals <- list(meals["breakfast"], meals["lunch"])


### Challenge ###

# Create a list that has the number of items you ate for each meal
# Hint: use the `lappy()` function to apply the `length()` function to each item
  number_meals <- lapply(meals, length)

# Write a function `add_pizza` that adds pizza to a given meal vector, and
# returns the pizza-fied vector
  add_pizza <- function(given_meal) {
    given_meal <- c(given_meal, "pizza")
    given_meal
  }

# Create a vector `better_meals` that is all your meals, but with pizza!
